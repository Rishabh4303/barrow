‘A barrow by a beacon’ is a short story about a walk, told in a random order. You can read it at http://barrow.matthewsheret.com and read about the making of it at https://matthewsheret.wordpress.com/2015/03/31/making-a-barrow-by-a-beacon/

It’s the first website I’ve made, so if you have comments please be kind.
